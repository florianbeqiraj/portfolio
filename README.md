## Tech Stack

When choosing the tech stack for this project, I prioritized using tools I am already familiar with and have worked with during my apprenticeship. This approach allows me to consolidate my knowledge and build upon my existing skills. However, I am also open to exploring new technologies and incorporating them into the project to enhance its capabilities.

The tech stack includes a combination of technologies that I have experience with, as well as new ones that I'm excited to learn and apply. For each technology used, I have provided a skill level rating to indicate my proficiency in that particular area.

My goal is to showcase my expertise in these technologies and demonstrate how I can effectively leverage them to create a compelling and efficient portfolio website.
